*Algorithm Analysis:
-the absolute running time of an algorithm can't be predicted, since it depends on a number of factors:
 -programming langauage used.
 -the computer the program runs on.
 -other programs running at the same time.
 -quality of operating system.

-we evaluate the performance  of an algorithm in terms of its input size.
*time complexity : amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size.
*space complexity : amount of memory taken by an algorithm to run , as a function of input size.

-how to represent complexity:
*asymptotic notations:
  -Mathematical tools to represent time and space complexity.
  1.Big-o Notation -worst case complexity.
  2.Omega Notation -best case complexity.
  3.Theta Notation -average case complexity.
